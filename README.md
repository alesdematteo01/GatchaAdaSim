# GatchaAdaSim

GatchaAdaSim is a Gatcha Simulator, starring the people of this Apple Academy year! 

This application is realized with the following features:
- a pull mechanic, which gives you the ability to obtain a random card;
- a probability algorithm, which manages the randomness system of the application;
- an inventory view, to check which cards did you pull;
- a rarity system, to select which cards are harder to obtain. 

The goal of this project is to gain a better unterstanding of UIkit and SwiftUI features, to integrate them and to use the best of both the code languages.
To be more precise, we decided to speriment with the Container Views and the Hosting Views, to be able to add SwiftUI contents and animations in an application, which started as a UIkit app.
